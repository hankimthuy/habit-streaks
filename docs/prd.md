# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Product Overview
**Product Name:** FlowStreaks (formerly Habit Streaks)
**Product Type:** Life OS / Capacity Manager
**Status:** In Development

## 2. Product Vision & Purpose
**The Shift:** FlowStreaks represents a graduation from simply demanding consistency (a traditional habit tracker) to actively managing your capacity to achieve that consistency. It acknowledges that users have complex lives, and blind adherence to streaks can be detrimental. FlowStreaks is designed to be an ecosystem that helps users map out the realistic, pressure-free reality of their day.

## 3. The Core Problem
**Previous Focus (Habit Streaks):** Lack of consistency. The focus was on isolated behaviors without context.
**New Focus (FlowStreaks):** Cognitive overload, context switching, and productivity dysmorphia. The modern user is overwhelmed by demands and often feels inadequate despite doing a lot, because traditional trackers don't account for exhaustion or life events (e.g., a 2-hour badminton session, a stressful client meeting).

## 4. Target Audience & Mindset
**User Mindset:** "I have a lot going on. What is the realistic, pressure-free reality of my day?"
The user is someone who wants to be productive and consistent but is bogged down by the complexities of daily life and the guilt associated with rigid streak-tracking.

## 5. Metrics of Success
**Old Metric:** The length of the streak.
**New Metrics:** 
1. Peace of mind.
2. Focused execution.
3. A visual sense of accomplishment at the end of the day.

## 6. Key Principles
- **Context-Aware Consistency:** Tracking habits within the context of daily energy and capacity.
- **Capacity Management:** Helping users understand what they can realistically achieve today.
- **Guilt-Free Tracking:** Removing the punishment aspect of broken streaks when life happens.
- **Holistic View:** Integrating tasks, habits, and energy levels into a single Life OS.
