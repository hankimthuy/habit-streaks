# Product Roadmap: FlowStreaks

This roadmap outlines the transition from a traditional habit tracker (Habit Streaks) to a comprehensive Life OS and Capacity Manager (FlowStreaks).

## Phase 1: Rebranding & Core Foundation (Current)
**Goal:** Shift the visual identity and core metric away from punishing streaks to flow and capacity.
- [ ] **Rebranding:** Change app name, logos, and copy from Habit Streaks to FlowStreaks.
- [ ] **UI/UX Overhaul:** Soften the design language; remove punitive "streak broken" alerts.
- [ ] **Daily Reflection:** Introduce a basic end-of-day summary that emphasizes accomplishments over failures.

## Phase 2: Context & Capacity Introduction
**Goal:** Begin capturing the "why" behind the user's day to reduce productivity dysmorphia.
- [ ] **Energy/Capacity Checking:** Simple daily check-ins (e.g., "High Energy", "Exhausted", "Stressed").
- [ ] **Context Tags:** Allow users to tag days with major events (e.g., "2-hour badminton", "Client meeting").
- [ ] **Dynamic Expectations:** Adjust daily habit targets based on the user's declared capacity.

## Phase 3: The Ecosystem (Life OS)
**Goal:** Fully realize the vision of a system that manages cognitive overload and context switching.
- [ ] **Smart Prioritization:** The app suggests what to focus on based on capacity and context.
- [ ] **Unified Dashboard:** A single view that answers "What is the realistic reality of my day?" combining habits, tasks, and context.
- [ ] **Advanced Insights:** Visualizing the relationship between context (e.g., stress) and execution, ultimately proving the value of the "Peace of Mind" metric.

## Phase 4: Integrations & Automation
**Goal:** Automatically gather context to minimize manual input.
- [ ] **Calendar Integration:** Automatically detect busy/stressful days.
- [ ] **Health/Fitness Integration:** Automatically adjust physical habit expectations based on workout data or sleep quality.
